# Ethereum 2.0
* Three big problems:
    1. Scalability
    2. Privacy
    3. Smart Contract Security

Some solutions:
* Sharding - reduce scalabilty issues
* Proof of Stake - improve transaction finality
* Zcash collaboration - enable private transactions
* Vyper Smart Contract Language - more secure language

The future of Ethereum is very bright, but there are some problem areas that are in work.

Currently, the Ethereum network has a theoretical limit of 15 transactions/sec,
which is much less than the 45k txns/sec that payment processors like Visa can manage,
and far, far less than what would be needed to enable general-purpose dapps.
Initiates like Sharding and Proof of Stake are intended to reduce the costs,
both economic and computational, with running the Ethereum network, as well as
improve the transaction bandwidth to the level required to handle the demand of a
universe full of dapps.
Proof of Stake also has the nice side effect of nearly eliminating the environmental impacts
of safeguarding blockchain networks, the emissions of which, by 2020, will be more than
an industrialized western nation like Denmark.

In order to protect the privacy and security of the general population,
there needs to be a reasonable means of making private transactions.
For vulnerable populations like refugees and citizens of authoritarian regimes
this is especially important, with key members of the community promoting this
as one of the primary needs of users of this technology.
Recently, the Ethereum community was able to integrate the technology behind
privacy-focused cryptocurrency Z-cash, which is called zk-SNARKS or "zero-knowledge proofs",
and send a private transaction that is secured by the public Ethereum network.
Future collaborations of this type are becoming increasingly important to the project.

Lastly, as some of you may know, there are big problems with Solidity,
the Smart Contract language Ethereum currently uses to create Dapps.
Almost a billion dollars of funds (at a Ether price of $1000) were lost since the project's inception,
a frankly unsustainable amount of money for the platform to be successful in the long term.
While Solidity was successful in getting web developers on board early in the project's life,
security-orientated languages (like Vyper) will need to be developed that mitigate many of the
issues that have been discovered with smart contracts, and allow developers to create safe, optimal
contracts for their Dapps with minimal hassle and special knowledge.
