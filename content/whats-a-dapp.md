# What is a Dapp?

*Decentralized Application*

**Facts:**
1. Apps run the world
2. Servers run apps
3. Companies run servers
4. ...
5. Companies run the world!

*What if there was a different way...*

???

A *Dapp* is a decentralized application.
*Decentralized* is a contentious description,
but everyone knows what an app is!

Apps run the world, at least the digital one.
And if you have an interest in technology, you also know that most apps
run based off of web servers that large companies like Google, Facebook,
and Amazon use to collect billions of bytes of personal information.
They use this information, often without our consent or even knowledge,
to help advertisers sell us products, improve their machine learning algorithms,
and about a 1,000 other uses that most of us couldn't even fathom.

# What is a Dapp?

*The Internet was created to be decentralized*

**Reasons why Internet has Centralized:**
1. Web servers are complicated to set up and run
2. Programming is difficult
3. Business logic ($$$) must be trusted
4. We desire easy and fun User Experiences and GUIs
5. *Free* is the best price

???

The Internet, as a concept and early into it's implementation,
was inherantly a decentralizing technology.
It was meant to help people all across the world to connect
and share information openly and freely.

However, back when it was invented and even up to now,
there are major hurdles the prevented the Internet from
actualizing the dream.

Who here has set up a web server?
Only about 2% of the population possesses the skills to do
this complicated task, and very few of us would want to maintain
a web server in order to use the Internet every day.
So we delegated that task to bigger companies.

Most of us here are developers.
We all know what an exceedingly difficult task programming can be.
Imagine having to use a command line every time you interact with Facebook or Google.
We delegated that task too.

On top of that, we trust the reputation of the companies that provide our services
to provide code that does exactly what we want, whether it be posting a picture to
our friend's wall or sending $30 for drinks to a friend's Venmo account.
There's absolutely no way we would want to do each and every one of those tasks manually.
We don't trust ourselves!

Now, in response to this, the real reason why Silicon Valley and the tech giants of the
world won over the Internet is by making it slick, easy to use, and relatively bug-free.
And to sum it all up, they took all of this work in providing us these desirable products,
and they turned around and gave it to us for absolutely "Free"!
Isn't that amazing?

# What is a Dapp?

**Reasons why we can decentralize the Internet:**
1. Clients are powerful enough to run most software
2. We can share code quickly and easily (CDNs)
3. Blockchains can store data and business logic
4. We are getting very good at UX and UI
5. People are learning the price of *Free*

???

The world is much different from back before Y2K.
We have amazing technologies built up over many years of
hard work by 10s of millions of technology professionals.
We have smartphones more powerful than the supercomputers available when the Internet was invented!
We have web browsers and web technologies like Javascript and HTML,
ways to store data for easy access.
We have entire professions who are experts at creating amazing User Experiences,
as well as digital artisians making beautiful front ends for all our favorite apps.

2017 will probably go down as the *Year of the Blockchain*,
the year the world discovered that data and business logic can be stored
in a trustworthy, decentralized network which can do more than just move digital coins around.
I think that 2017 will also be recorded as the year the majority of people realized that
the large companies, under the promise of *Free*, squandered our trust and paved way
for the next wave of digital interactions.

This is what *Dapp* means to me.

So what is a Dapp *technically*? What are the pieces of the puzzle?

Blockchains are a major enabling technology.
Not just for sending magic internet money anymore,
it is really the *backend* of the distributed internet.
Fully-featured blockchains like Ethereum can store any kind of data or logic for a reasonable price.
Data like user profiles, encrypted personal details (that you control!), application state
and the rules for interacting and manipulating that data are all publically available and immutable,
enabling dapps to avoid the need to duplicate data.

User devices are a given. This can be a cell-phone, laptop, smartwatch, IoT Fridge, whatever device that
has a processor, enough memory to run the blockchain, and enough storage to fetch and run the dapp.

The last enabling component is the standard, trusty Content Delivery Network.
Ethereum's Swarm is the exactly the same as a regular CDN, but data storage occurs
over many different file servers all incentivized using the Ethereum network to hold
the data (encrypted or not) and trustfully deliver the files requested to a client device in parallel,
in much the same way that torrenting works.
Ethereum's Whisper is a similar technology that does the same for temporary message communication between devices and different dapps.

Every component of the Dapp is open source, auditable, and designed to be secure against unauthorized tampering.
The cryptographic keys use to access your user credentials, for instance, or the upload files to the Swarm CDN
are yours and yours alone, never having to leave your device.
Your personal data can be stored encrypted in a similar way, but ultimately be used for verification through secure channels,
and only as much proof is needed to gain the access you request.

The hope is, that Web 3.0 and the Dapp architecture can substantially improve on the Internet as we know it,
and more faithfully acheive the original dream of the Internet; a way to help people all across the world to connect
and share information openly and freely.
