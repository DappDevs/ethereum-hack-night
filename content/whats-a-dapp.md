# What is a Dapp?

*Decentralized Application*

**Facts:**
1. Apps run the world
2. Servers run apps
3. Companies run servers
4. ...
5. Companies run the world!

*What if there was a different way...*

What is a Dapp?

A *Dapp* is a decentralized application.
*Decentralized* might be an unfamiliar term for some,
but everyone knows the world runs on software applications.
And if you have an interest in technology, you also know that many apps
run on web servers that large organizations like Google, Facebook,
and Amazon maintain. In return for hosting these applications
their servers collect trillions of bytes of personal information,
often without our consent or even knowledge,
to help advertisers sell products, improve machine learning algorithms,
or about a 1,000 other uses we don't even know about.

I'm a fan of Frank Herbet, the author of Dune, and to riff of a famous quote of his
"Those who control the DATA control the universe!"

Decentralization, to me, means putting that control back in the hands of the users.

# The Centralized Internet

*The Internet was created to be decentralized exchange of knowledge*

**Reasons why Internet has Centralized:**
1. Web servers are complicated to set up and run
2. Programming is difficult
3. Business logic ($$$) must be trusted
4. We desire easy and fun User Experiences and GUIs
5. *Free* is the best price

???

The Internet, as a concept and in the early part of it's long life,
was supposed to be a decentralizing technology.
It was meant to help people all across the world connect
and share information openly and freely,
and Democratize knowledge.

However, since it was invented up until now,
there are major hurdles the prevent the Internet from
actualizing the dream of decentralization.

Who here has set up a web server?
Less than 0.2% of the population possesses the skills necessary to do this complicated task,
and very few of that 0.2% would want to maintain a web server in order to use the Internet every day.
Because it was hard, we delegated that task.

Most of us here are developers.
We all know what a difficult task programming can be.
Imagine having to use a command line every time you wanted to make a Facebook post or run a Google search.
Imagine having to explain THAT to your friends and family every time they called you for tech support.
We're lazy, so of course we delegated this task.

We trust the reputation of large organizations to provide code that does exactly what we want,
whether it be posting a picture to our friend's wall or sending $30 for drinks to a friend's Venmo account.
There is absolutely no way we would trust ourselves to do this manually each and every time.
Because we know we make mistakes, we also delegated this task.

The real reason why Silicon Valley and the tech giants of the world run the Internet is 
by providing these services for us.
They made it slick, easy to use, and relatively bug-free.
And to top it all off, despite this significant amount of work in providing us these services, 
they turned it around and gave it to us for absolutely "Free"!

Isn't that amazing?

# Can We Decentralize It?

**YES**

1. Clients are powerful enough to run most software
2. We can share code quickly and easily (CDNs)
3. We are getting very good at UX and UI
4. Blockchains can store data and business logic
5. People are learning the price of *Free*

*Also, we have CryptoKitties. The time is now!*

The state of the internet is much different from back before Y2K.

We have amazing technologies built up over many years of
hard work by tens of millions of technology professionals.
We have smartphones more powerful than the supercomputers available 30 years ago.
We have fast web browsers and pervasive technologies like Javascript and HTML.
We have easy and cheap ways to store data for quick access.
We have entire professions of people who are experts at creating amazing User Experiences,
as well as digital artisians making beautiful front ends for all our favorite apps.

We now have *blockchain technology*!
2017 will probably go down as the *Year of the Blockchain*,
the year the world discovered that blockchains can do more than just move digital coins around.

I also think that 2017 will be recorded as the year the majority of people realized that
these large organizations, under the promise of *Free*, violated our trust and inadvertantly
paved the way to decentralize the internet.

We finally have all the pieces needed to do this.

But a decentralized internet means nothing without decentralized applications.

# What actually is a Dapp?

**Parts of a Dapp:**
![Dapp](https://blog.ethereum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-5.37.32-PM.png)

???

So what is a decentralized application *technically*? What are the pieces of the puzzle?

Well, user devices are the core of any application.
They provide the client that the user interacts with.
They can be a cell-phone, laptop, smartwatch, IoT Fridge, hardware wallet, smart toaster,
whatever device that has a processor and enough memory and storage to run the application and it's framework.
In a Dapp, each user device will store one or more cryptographic key pairs,
uniquely identifying that client by giving it a unique *address* on the Ethereum network.

Of course, blockchains are the major enabling technology for Dapps.
Not just for sending magic internet money anymore,
it is really the *backend* of the distributed internet.
Fully-featured blockchains like Ethereum can store any kind of data or logic for a reasonable price.
Data like user profiles, application state, and the rules for interacting and manipulating that data
are all publically available and immutable, enabling dapps to avoid the need to store duplicate data
on centralized servers that are prone to hacks and data losses and endless user frustrations.

The last enabling component is the standard, trusty Content Delivery Network.
Ethereum's Swarm is exactly the same as a regular CDN, but data storage occurs
over many different file servers all incentivized to hold the data (encrypted or not)
and trustfully deliver the files requested to a client device,
using peer-to-peer file-sharing protocols like bittorrent.
Whisper is a similar technology that provides temporary messaging between different devices and dapps,
messages that are destroyed once delivered.
These services are what enables a Dapp be truly decentralized and server-less!

Most importantly, every component of the Dapp is open source, auditable,
and designed to be secure against unauthorized tampering.
The private keys used to provide access to your user credentials or upload files to the Swarm CDN
are yours and yours alone, never having to leave your device.
Your personal data can be stored encrypted in a similar way,
never having to leave your device unless requested,
only needed for verification through secure channels,
with only as much proof as needed to grant your request.

The hope is, that Web 3.0 and the Dapp architecture can substantially improve on the Internet
as we know it today, and more faithfully acheive the original dream of the Internet:
a way to help people all across the world connect and share information openly and freely.
