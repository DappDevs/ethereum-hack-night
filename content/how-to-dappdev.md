So now that you know a bit more about what Dapps are and how they work,
we wanted to go over some of the motivation behind this community.

Particularly, we want to tell you why you should be a DappDev,
what a DappDev actually is, and how to get involved in our community.

# Why be a DappDev?

"When the internet bubble popped,
the people who only invested their money into internet stocks lost a lot of money.
However, those who invested their skills into learning how to make apps on the
internet did very well for themselves."

Andreas Antonopoulos

**Some Reasons:**
* Exciting
* Impactful
* Challenging
* Lucrative
* Flexible

*Or just invest all your retirement savings into the BitconnectX ICO!*

*We swear it's not a Ponzi Scheme!*

Here are 5 reasons why I think you should become a DappDev.

First off, this field is exciting. I don't think I need to explain that to you,
but the general excitement of what we can build with this technology is intoxicating.

The main reason why it is exciting is because so many of the potential usecases of the
tech are just super impactful to our day-to-day lives and have the real potential to
improve them. There is just so much good that can be accomplished here.

As impactful as it is, one of my personal reasons for getting into dapp development
is how challenging it is. You will always be learning, growing, and evolving in this
space. If you are someone that likes to stick with what you know, this is the wrong
place for you.

Of course, because of these reasons, being a dapp dev is currently extremely lucrative,
and will remain a good career option in the near term. If and when the "Crypto Bubble Pops"
the skills you learn will not only make you very valuable as developers in this new paradigm,
but will also make you better engineers and more seasoned entrepeneurs in the long run.

Lastly, I think one of the coolest aspects of being a DappDev is flexibility.
Because of how in-demand you are, you can really pick and choose what projects matter to
you the most. In the long term, I believe you will be able to work on several projects,
earning tokens or dividends on those projects, and as they flourish take time off
and enjoy what life has to offer.

We are just one group of people, and we can only do so much by ourselves,
so we need your involvement to grow and structure our movement.
Here's how you can help.

The first thing we ask is that you learn a little bit about the tech.
You don't have to be an expert, but like any technology, it pays to
understand the terms and concepts underpinning what it is you wish to work on.
You may find yourself intrigued by a particular problem that needs to get solved,
or you might be more of the type of person that enjoys combining concepts together
to form even better ideas. It all starts here.

The second is that you familarize yourself with some of the concepts underpinning
the economics of what we are building. Terms like "Futures" and "Prediction Markets",
or what it means to "Stake" tokens on a particular outcome, these are very important
design mechanisms in crypto that need to be well-understood to be used effectively.

Next is we need to understand what particular use cases are a successful use of the
underlying technology. This serves a double duty. Firstly, you will learn more about
the ecosystem and what problems are already being solved, or what projects you can
leverage in unique ways to solve other problems. But more importantly, it will help
you conceptualize the very difficult concepts and design patterns that are needed to
build Dapps. Together, we can form a consensus around how to evaluate all of these projects.

I think one of the most important takeaways I would like to share with you today is
that, given most of these projects are open source projects and built off of many other
open source tools, you have to become an open source developer yourself. This doesn't
mean complaining when things don't work right, but actually participating and building
these tools so that they are robust and useful to the larger ecosystem.
It used to be that open source developers either worked for free, or were somehow
amazing enough to be sponsored by large corporations, but with projects like GitCoin
and Solidified offering bounties for contributing and identifying issues with dapps,
you can actually earn a fair amount of additional income with your contributions.
It's really a win-win!

Last but most importantly, you have to participate in the community.
This not only means joining many different online communities and sharing your thoughts
and learnings as you chug from the fountain of crypto knowledge, but also gathering in
person, like we're doing here today, and discussing with people face-to-face.
One of the biggest issues we are trying to solve with our organization is providing
a means for the community to get together and help each other, and the movement, succeed.
Face-to-face interaction is one of the most effective means of cementing knowledge,
and the ideas you'll generate among this particularly imaginative crowd are just intoxicating.

We have a Slack, which will help everyone stay connected as we go our separate ways,
as well a GitHub to colloborate on projects together and create a repository of shared knowledge.

We also will be running some workshops in the near future,
which will be more formal oppurtunities for you to get together
and learn exactly how things work, so keep an eye out for these events.
