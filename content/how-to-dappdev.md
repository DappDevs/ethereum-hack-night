# How do I value crypto projects?

*How to evaluate a technology startup:*
1. The problem
2. The solution
3. The market impact
4. The competition
5. The team

???

Most of you probably came here with this question in mind.
It was either the primary question you came here to have answered,
or it is a significant component of how you figure out whether you
want to apply yourself to this new technology.
It's a fair question, and deserves a good answer.

That answer is simple: you evaluate it like any other venture
capitalist evaluates a technology startup.
Since I am not here to evaluate the investment potential of any
given crypto project or startup running an ICO, I will answer these
questions with the crypto movement in general in mind.

The problem is pretty simple, if a bit grandiose:
The web is one of the biggest innovations in the history of mankind,
but it is only benefiting a select few at the center of it all.

The solution is also fairly idealized:
blockchain technology has the ability to decentralize trust
and free us to engage in peer-to-peer commerce without reliance
on (and enrichment of) trusted third parties.

The potential impact is huge:
Web 3.0 will enable us to build a more equitable, global economy
where the concerns of the average human share equal importance
to that of the world's largest institutions.
This will revolutionize global commerce as we know it!

Once you've defined the market you will be operating in, most experienced VCs
next wonder about who your competition is.
Usually your competition means other businesses or organizations that
operate in your intended market, or aim to have the same impact through a different means.
But if I define the market as "everyone", and the impact as "everything",
who is the competition?
I hope you understand that for cryptocurrency in general, the competition
isn't another business, it's another way of thinking.
The way of thinking currently espoused by the world,
and the governments and organizations that run it.

Most of these "competitors" are actually fairly benevolent to our cause,
or at least ambivalent to it.
While there are some malicious parties out there of course,
but we should try to think of our competitors as potential partners
we should be working with instead of burning the whole thing down and starting over.
But we must also keep a strong conviction to the world we seek to build,
especially when we disagree with what these "partners" think they know about
the world we live in. One of my personal mantras sums this up:
"Strong opinions, loosely held"

That's all well and good, but here's the interesting part:
Who forms "The Team" of a movement that inherantly has no leaders?
The answer is anyone and everyone who involves themselves of course,
and I'm hoping that means you!

One of the important indicators to the majority of experienced venture capitalists
that a project they are investing in will ultimately be a successful investment
is the passion, dedication, and experience of the team members.
This is especially important to the crypto movement,
where the pace of innovation is quickly being outdone by the financial enthusiasm around it.
As any survivor of the dot com bubble will be quick to tell you,
this is exactly how a bubble forms, and when the majority of people realize this
and some event comes along that shatters this perception, this bubble will pop like any other.

This is a good thing, it clears the air of oppurtunists and only leaves those who
understand the true potential of the technology their movement has been evangilizing.
The period of time between the 2000's and today was one of vast technological improvement,
and the internet is every bit as integral to our lives today as those voices of
the web era were telling us. They just got the timing wrong.

I can't tell you when the bubble will pop around cryptocurrency, or even if it will happen,
but I can tell you that promise of the technology has a good foundation,
and that it will absolutely change the world over the next decade or two.
It's your choice whether or not you want to be a part of it, in whatever way you can,
with whatever skillset you may have and whatever time you may have to give.

So, with that out of the way, you might be asking "How can I get involved?".
The purpose of our group is to shed a bit of light onto that path.
We are just one group of people, and we can only do so much by ourselves,
so we need your involvement to grow and structure our movement.

The first thing we ask is that you learn a little bit about the tech.
You don't have to be an expert, but like any technology, it pays to
understand the terms and concepts underpinning what it is you wish to work on.
You may find yourself intrigued by a particular problem that needs to get solved,
or you might be more of the type of person that enjoys combining concepts together
to form even better ideas. It all starts here.

The second is that you familarize yourself with some of the concepts underpinning
the economics of what we are building. Terms like "Futures" and "Prediction Markets",
or what it means to "Stake" tokens on a particular outcome, these are very important
design mechanisms in crypto that need to be well-understood to be used effectively.

Next is we need to understand what particular use cases are a successful use of the
underlying technology. This serves a double duty. Firstly, you will learn more about
the ecosystem and what problems are already being solved, or what projects you can
leverage in unique ways to solve other problems. But more importantly, it will help
you conceptualize the very difficult concepts and design patterns that are needed to
build Dapps. Together, we can form a consensus around how to evaluate all of these projects.

I think one of the most important takeaways I would like to share with you today is
that, given most of these projects are open source projects and built off of many other
open source tools, you have to become an open source developer yourself. This doesn't
mean complaining when things don't work right, but actually participating and building
these tools so that they are robust and useful to the larger ecosystem.
It used to be that open source developers either worked for free, or were somehow
amazing enough to be sponsored by large corporations, but with projects like GitCoin
and Solidified offering bounties for contributing and identifying issues with dapps,
you can actually earn a fair amount of additional income with your contributions.
It's really a win-win!

Last but most importantly, you have to participate in the discussion.
This not only means joining many different online communities and sharing your thoughts
and learnings as you chug from the fountain of crypto knowledge, but also gathering in
person, like we're doing here today, and discussing with people face-to-face.
One of the biggest issues we are trying to solve with our organization is providing
a means for the community to get together and help each other, and the movement, succeed.
Face-to-face interaction is one of the most effective means of cementing knowledge,
and the ideas you'll generate among this particularly imaginative crowd are just intoxicating.

We also will be running some workshops, more formal oppurtunities for you to get
together and learn exactly how things work, so keep an eye out for these events.
