So, what's the best stack to program Dapps on?

We think Ethereum is the most exciting ecosystem to develop Dapps with,
and we'll tell you why!

# Why Ethereum?

1. 10000+ Developers Worldwide
2. 1000+ Active Projects
3. Over 1m smart contracts
4. Over 18 million accounts
5. 200+ companies in the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance
6. Exactly 1 Vitalik

Ethereum has the greatest chance for success

Stats:
* Most Active Developers
* Most Interesting Projects
* The most innovative smart contracts
* One of the highest continuous market caps
* The most optimism in it's future

Ethereum Foundation:
* Active in all aspects of dapp framework
* Extensive research in scalability, privacy, and security
* Major enterprise partners
* One of the brightest minds in crypto

Plus, *Ethereum* just sounds cool!

What if we're wrong?
* Skills and Knowledge transfer to competitors
* Only differences are underlying tradeoffs and programming language
* Develop discipline in development transferrable to other fields

Our primary reason we believe Ethereum is the best framework to develop with
is that it has the greatest chance of success in the long term.

It has the most developer talent,
the most active, interesting projects,
the widest use of smart contracts,
one of the highest continuous market caps of any cryptocurrency,
and by far the most optimism for the future (in my opinion).

Ethereum is very, very active in the development of all aspects
the dapp framework and ensuring that it is made possible,
with active research and extensive funding from the Ethereum Foundation,
major enterprise partners like Consensys, Microsoft, and Intel from the EEA,
and one of the brightest minds in the space at the helm of it all.

Plus, *Ethereum* just sounds cool!

Even if Ethereum isn't ultimately the blockchain to rule all blockchains,
the skills and knowledge needed to learn distributed application development
will be transferable to whatever competitors come into existence.
The major differences between Ethereum and other smart contract frameworks
are simply the underlying tradeoffs use to secure the blockchain,
and what programming language you use to write the smart contracts.
