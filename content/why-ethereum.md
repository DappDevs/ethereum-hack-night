So, what's the best stack to program Dapps on?

We think Ethereum is the most exciting ecosystem to develop Dapps with,
and we'll tell you why!

# Why Ethereum?

1. 10000+ Developers Worldwide
2. 1000+ Active Projects
3. Over 1m smart contracts
4. Over 18 million accounts
5. 200+ companies in the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance
6. Exactly 1 Vitalik

Our primary reason we believe Ethereum is the best framework to develop with
is that it has the greatest chance of success in the long term.

It has the most developer talent,
the most active, interesting projects,
the biggest use case of blockchain (which is smart contracts),
one of the highest continuous market caps of any cryptocurrency,
and by far the most optimism for the future (in my opinion).

Ethereum is very, very active in the development of all aspects
the dapp framework and ensuring that it is made possible,
with active research and extensive funding from the Ethereum Foundation,
major enterprise partners like Consensys, Microsoft, and Intel from the EEA,
and one of the brightest minds in the space at the helm of it all.

Even if Ethereum isn't ultimately the blockchain to rule all blockchains,
the skills and knowledge needed to learn distributed application development
will be transferrable to whatever competitors come into existance.
The major differences between Ethereum and other smart contract frameworks
are simply the underlying tradeoffs use to secure the blockchain,
and what programming language you use to write smart contracts.

Plus, *Ethereum* just sounds cool!
