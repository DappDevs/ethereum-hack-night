So, what is Ethereum? First a little backstory...

Ethereum originated from a young Russian-Canadian programmer named Vitalik Buterin.
Vitalik's father had introduced Buterin to Bitcoin in 2012 at age 17,
and he became obsessed obsessed with cryptocurrencies.
In 2013, after working with several other prominent cryptocurrency developers
and thought-leaders all over the world, he returned home to work on the Ethereum Whitepaper
after identifying a need to create a cryptocurrency with a general-purpose scripting language
following his work on MasterCoin.

After publishing the paper, at the age of 19 he dropped out of college at the University of Waterloo
when he received a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship grant.
He formed a development group with a team of 3 other developers:
Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson.
By mid-2014 it became clear that the idea should move forward, and the team formed
a non-profit entity in Switzerland and raised $20m in Bitcoin to fund the development
of the Ethereum platform.

By May of the following year, Ethereum had released it's first public beta,
offering 25k Ether rewards for stress testing the network.
In March 2016, Ethereum had it's first public release,
including improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security.
Following the success of the first public release,
Ethereum formed a Decentralized Autonomous Organization called The DAO,
which was a set of smart contracts intended to invest into the burgeoning Ethereum ecosystem.
It raised a record $150m in it's crowdsale (15% of all Ether),
and is often referred to as the first ICO.
Following the success of that crowdsale, hackers hacked the smart contracts used by The DAO
to steal 3.6m Ether from the newly-founded organization.
Since the funds were put into a 28-day escrow before they were to be released,
the Ethereum community came together to discuss what to do about the impending hack.
Ultimately, in a contentious hard-fork off-shooting what is now Ethereum Classic,
the Ethereum community reversed The DAO Hack and returned all investor funds.
This is widely credited as the first real test of the Ethereum community,
a test many consider to have been appropiately handled given the circumstances.
Since the resolution of The DAO hack, the price of Ethereum has been on the rise,
fueling the growth of the overall platform in the global cryptocurrency community.

2017 was a wild year for Ethereum.
The Ethereum Platform was the basis for over 200 ICOs raising more than $3b.
The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance added 86 technology companies, including many large companies.
It increased the amount of transactions very close to it's limit,
with the CryptoKitties project in Dec 2017 ultimately causing a huge network slowdown showing
the limits of the platform.

2018 is going to be an interesting year for Ethereum.
Casper, the PoS upgrade, has recently gone into Beta Testing,
and Sharding, a method for Ethereum to increase it's transaction capacity,
is under active development with a prototype slated for later this year.

Now, what exactly *is* Ethereum?
