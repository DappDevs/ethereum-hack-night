### Intro to Dapp Development with Ethereum
*Presented by DappDevs.org*

???

(Chapter Host)

# What is DappDevs?

Our focus is on building an autonomous learning community that enables
teachers and students (members) to learn about building blockchain applications,
primarily within the Ethereum ecosystem, the most well supported open source framework.

We support an open and friendly environment within our community.
It’s your platform for asking questions, sharing information, and giving feedback.
Everyone comes with unique experiences, opinions,
and perspectives that make the community even more valuable.

Passionate community builders interested in running their own DappDevs community can do
so as long as they follow the community guidelines.
We will help them get set-up and provide resources / guidance where we can.

We currently have chapters established in New Haven, Hartford, and Stamford.

# Next Steps

As of right now, we’re running this intro series until early March across our 3 chapters.
We would love your support on getting more people like yourselves to attend.
If you like what see and hear today, please share!

From there, we will run our first workshop in late March.
Stay tuned on updates for this event in our Meetup Group and slack channel,
both of which you can find on our website, [dappdevs.org](dappdevs.org).

# Agenda

Our Agenda for today is to present for 30-45 mins on some background information

Additionally, we will go over the Ethereum framework, the specific tools in the ecosystem,
as well as some examples of popular Ethereum dapps and what their use cases of Ethereum are.
Lastly, we will sum up a list of resources of where to get started learning more about the
