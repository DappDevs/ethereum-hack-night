**What is DappDevs?**

Our focus is on building an autonomous learning community that enables
members to learn and teach each other about building blockchain applications,
primarily within the Ethereum ecosystem, the most well supported blockchain app framework.

We support an open and friendly environment within our community.
It’s your platform for asking questions, sharing information, and giving feedback.
Everyone comes with unique experiences, opinions,
and perspectives that make the community as a whole even more valuable.

Passionate community builders interested in running their own DappDevs community can do
so as long as they follow the community guidelines.
We will help them setup their local chapter and provide resources / guidance where we can.

We currently have chapters established in New Haven, Hartford, and Stamford.

**Next Steps**

As of right now, we’re running this intro series until early March across our 3 chapters.
We would love your support on getting more people like yourselves to attend.
If you like what see and hear today, please share!

From there, we will run our first workshop in late March.
Stay tuned on updates for this event on our Meetup Page and Slack,
both of which you can find on our website, [dappdevs.org](dappdevs.org).

**Agenda**

Our Agenda for today is to present for 30-45 mins on some background information
about what a dapp is and how to get started programming one.

Next, we will go over the Ethereum dapp framework, and give a detailed background
on the technology and how it works.

Lastly, we will tell you what the next steps are in order to become a DappDev,
as well as how to get further involved with DappDevs and what this community means to us.

After the presentation, our speaker will answer questions for approximately 15-30 mins,
and then we'll break for networking and casual conversation.

Please note we have to be out of the space by [time].

[Mention if we are doing something after]
