# Let's Hack!
Introduce my example (everyone is going to build/deploy a wallet and participate in an "ICO" on the testnet, then compete to win an auction with the tokens)
I will have a reference wallet example people can use if they don't want to build their own

---
      
# I Made a Smart Contract, Now What?
Work through how to set up an Ethereum node, and deploy a contract
      
---

# Let's Do It!
No seriously, go do it
Let people hack for 20-30 minutes on wallet, help people out with questions

---

# What are these Tokens everyone is talking about?
Run our "ICO" and deploy our auction contract

---

# It's time to HODL and FOMO
ICO and auction run for 10 mins, whomever has the winning bid of the auction contract
gets mad props and maybe a t-shirt or something
