# Ethereum Hack Night!
## `#DecentralizeEverything`
      
### Presented by Bryant Eisenbach

---

# Agenda
1. Overview of Ethereum
2. What are we Hacking?
3. Setup a Node, Deploy a Contract
4. Hack!
5. Let's run an ICO!
6. Auction a prize!
7. Future of Ethereum
8. Q&A

---

# What is Ethereum?
1. It's a blockchain
Specifically, a "Secure, Transactional-based State Machine"-on-a-Blockchain

---

# What is Ethereum?
1. It's a blockchain
2. It's a computer
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a stack-based processor
* Stack, 1024 stack limit
* Memory, 256-bit registers
* Storage, unlimited storage ($$$)
* Pay-per-use of resources in "gas" (solves Halting Problem)

---

# What is Ethereum?
1. It's a blockchain
2. It's a computer
3. It's a database
A turing complete decentralized database engine
* Lookups are fast, thanks to "Merkle Trees"
"Everyone should bow down and pray to Ralph Merkle" - Vitalik, DevCon3
* Schema + Rules (Queries) are stored in "Smart Contracts"

---

# How does Ethereum work?
* Everything is an address (20 byte public key checksum)
* Two types of addresses:
    * "External Accounts" Basically Users
    * "Smart Contracts" Pieces of code
* External Accounts store Ether and start transactions
* Each node has 1 or more external accounts
* Smart Contracts are compiled bytecode stored at a specific location
* They interact with other addresses based on the rules

---

# Programming Languages

```javascript
/* Solidity (JavaScript-based syntax, current king) */
contract DNS {
    mapping (bytes32 => {address owner, uint128 ip}) domains
    function register(bytes32 domainName) {
        require(domains[domainName].owner == 0x0);
        domains[domainName].owner = msg.sender;
    }
    function setIP(bytes32 domainName, uint128 ip) {
        require(domains[domainName].owner == msg.sender);
        domains[domainName].ip = ip;
    }
}
```

```python
# Viper (python-based syntax, heavy development)
domains: { owner: address, ip: num }[bytes32]

def register(domain_name: bytes32):
    assert not self.domains[domain_name].owner
    self.domains[domain_name].owner = msg.sender

def set_ip(domain_name: bytes32, ip: num):
    assert self.domains[domain_name].owner == msg.sender
    self.domains[domain_name].ip = ip
```

# Tools
* Nodes (Geth, PyEVM, Parity)
* IDEs (Truffle, Populus, Remix)
* Web3 (Web3.js, Web3.py)
* Still Growing at an incredible rate

# Let's Hack!
Introduce my example (everyone is going to build/deploy a wallet and participate in an "ICO" on the testnet, then compete to win an auction with the tokens)
I will have a reference wallet example people can use if they don't want to build their own

---
      
# I Made a Smart Contract, Now What?
Work through how to set up an Ethereum node, and deploy a contract
      
---

# Let's Do It!
No seriously, go do it
Let people hack for 20-30 minutes on wallet, help people out with questions

---

# What are these Tokens everyone is talking about?
Run our "ICO" and deploy our auction contract

---

# It's time to HODL and FOMO
ICO and auction run for 10 mins, whomever has the winning bid of the auction contract
gets mad props and maybe a t-shirt or something

---

# Ethereum 2.0
future timeline of Ethereum's development

---

# Questions?
Close out & Q/A
